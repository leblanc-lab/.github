## leblanc-lab

We are a particle physics research group in the Brown University Department of Physics, making contributions to the CMS Experiment at CERN, and developing tools for future particle physics experiments.

Our research involves making precision measurements that test cutting-edge theoretical predictions, developing advanced techniques for reconstructing and calibrating hadronic objects in CMS, and leveraging AI to improve computational workflows at the LHC and beyond.
